Gcontent:Photo | Via Animal Place.OrgJoin the Animal Place in Grass Valley, CA for trick-or-treating in their barns and be sure to bring a pumpkin to feed to the pigs (for yours and the pigs’ safety, staff will feed the pigs directly).
The barns will be open and you’ll get vegan goodies every time you visit a new pasture. Make sure to dress up in a costume.
Schedule:

10:30-11:00 am – Make treats and feed the bunnies
11:00-11:30 am  – Make treats and feed the chickens
11:30-12:00 pm – Watch staff feed out donated pumpkins to pigs
12:00-12:30 pm – Trick or treat for the humans!


Admission is $5 and an RSVP is required.
Please note: For the safety of our youngest guests, the sheep, cows, goats, and big pigs will be closed to the public. You can wave and say hi to them over the fence. Just keep in mind that you will be entering barns and being around rescued animals. Please also note that they ask that costumes should not make any artificial noises (whistles, screams, etc.). Also, the animals may be distressed by costumes that completely obscure your face, so please take that into consideration. The rescued animals would love if you dress up as one of the species they rescue (sheep, donkey, goat, cow, rabbit, chicken, turkey, pig) and they might even give out additional treats.

Gcontent:Photo | latinbayareaThe 8th Annual Día de Los Muertos celebration at Calvary Catholic Cemetery will take place from 11 am to 4 pm on Saturday, October 28, 2017.
This year’s event will include:

Ritual, Music, and Dance
Face Painting and Children’s Crafts
Food, art, books, and t-shirts will be available for sale
A community altar for attendees to place their photos & memorabilia


Día de Los Muertos is one of Mexico’s traditional holidays reuniting and honoring beloved ancestors, family, and friends. It is an ancient ritual when the living commune with the dead – a mystical event when the veil is lifted between their two realms and they may share a day together. Día de Los Muertos is a time of celebration and a time to remember our deceased family and friends. Rather than to deny and fear death, this event teaches us to accept and contemplate the meaning of mortality and to celebrate life.

Idiot String
Come to Port Promise, California, a late-Victorian outpost where mysteries are part of the fabric of life and an old-fashioned tonic might do a body good. When a traveling Snake-Oil Seller comes to town with an Elixir full of promises, each of the Port Promise townsfolk come face to face with the prospect of a miraculous second chance.
Elixir of Life: Bay Area’s Autumn Evening Outdoor Play
October 20 to November 12, 2017
– Fridays @ 6:30 pm
– Saturdays & Sundays starts an hour after sunset
FREE
Due to space considerations, reservations are recommended. At most performances, a donation is suggested, but no one will be turned away for lack of funds.
Performed outdoors on Autumn evenings near dusk—when the separation between the physical world and the spiritual world is said to be at its most delicate—Elixir of Life elicits laughter, contemplation, and a sense that anything is possible.
Elixir of Life will be performed outdoors on FluxWagon, the mobile stage. Audience members of all ages are welcome, but Elixir of Life is best enjoyed by ages 9 and up.
